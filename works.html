                    First poster remix design (Fig.1)
                    <br>
                    This poster is a draft of the first time I learned to use photoshop, 
                    and although the skills are not mature, it was a pretty good start.

                    Remixing photographs (Fig.2)
                    <br>
                    I used photoshop and lightroom to crop and adjust elements from different 
                    photos and make a collage of them. I think I can continue to work on it to 
                    make the image more harmonious.

                    Remake of the painting The Swing (Fig.3)                    
                    <br>
                    In the remake process, I used Illustrator to recreate the famous painting 
                    The Swing. I used orange and a darker color palette to try to give the image 
                    the feeling of late fall.

                    In this design, the text is placed on top of the girl's head, so the background 
                    element can resonates with the title.

                    Poster design for a brand's event (Fig.5)
                    <br>
                    This poster was designed by me for a sale event for a milk tea brand. This event 
                    is not real, but I designed this event poster based on the identity of the brand.
