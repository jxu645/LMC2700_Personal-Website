                Hello there!
            </h1>
            <h2> 
                This is Jessie!
                I am a second year sophomore at Georgia Institute of Technology, 
                majoring in Computational Media. You can always find me around the student center
                and the Skiles building!
                <br>
                <br> I love my school life so far, but maintaining balance between school and life is not easy!
                <br> 
                <br> I love discovering places around me, and take photographs to save all the good memories 
                     that I appreciate. I play games in my free time a lot, and the passion of making good games  
                     and animations is the main reason that brought me to this major. 
                <br> 
                <br> I am ready entering second half of my sophomore year, wish I could stay humble, and do well!
